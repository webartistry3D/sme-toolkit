Build a modern, mobile-friendly web app called BizEase Tools — a no-login utility hub for entrepreneurs and small business owners.

The app should be built with React + TailwindCSS and deployed as a single-page app. It will include three simple tools, each fully client-side (no backend or database).

Main requirements:

1. Landing Page (Dashboard)

Header with logo/title “BizEase Tools” and a short tagline (“Smart tools for everyday business tasks”).

Three cards leading to the tools:

Invoice Generator 🧾

WhatsApp Link & QR Builder 💬

Profit Calculator 📊


Use a responsive grid layout, rounded cards, icons, and subtle motion.



2. Tool #1: Invoice Generator

Form fields: business name, client name, item list (description, qty, unit price), tax %, discount %, payment info (bank details), and optional logo upload.

Calculate subtotal, tax, discount, and total.

Button to “Generate PDF” using jspdf or html2canvas.

Optional: Save last used data in localStorage.



3. Tool #2: WhatsApp Link & QR Builder

Inputs: phone number, message text.

Output: generated WhatsApp link (https://wa.me/<number>?text=<encoded-message>).

Display and copy link button.

Generate QR code using qrcode.react.

Button to download QR as image.



4. Tool #3: Profit Calculator

Inputs: product cost, selling price, expenses (optional).

Output: profit, profit margin %, and suggested selling price.

Clear and recalculate buttons.

LocalStorage support to remember last values.




Design guidelines:

Use a clean, minimal business aesthetic (neutral background, accent color for CTAs).

Include smooth card hover animations (via Framer Motion if available).

Fully responsive (mobile-first).


Technical notes:

Pure frontend — no backend, database, or login.

Deployable on Render, Netlify, or Vercel.

Use React Router for simple navigation between tools.


Stretch goal (if time allows):

Add a “Share this tool” button that copies the tool URL.

Make the app installable as a PWA (manifest + service worker).


Generate clean, modular code with clear folder structure:

src/
├── components/
├── pages/
├── utils/
├── assets/
└── App.jsx

Deliver a working prototype ready to preview and refine.
